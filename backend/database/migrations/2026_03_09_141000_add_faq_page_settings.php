<h2>Ordering</h2>
<p><strong>Do you sell both standard products and custom fabrication?</strong><br>Yes. We supply selected standard products through the shop and also handle custom stainless steel fabrication and ventilation work.</p>
<p><strong>How do I request a custom quote?</strong><br>Use the quote request form and include as much project detail as possible, including drawings, dimensions, and site requirements.</p>
<h2>Delivery</h2>
<p><strong>How long does delivery take?</strong><br>Lead times depend on whether the item is stock-based or made to order. Standard items are usually faster; custom work depends on project scope and scheduling.</p>
<p><strong>Do you deliver across the UK?</strong><br>Yes. Delivery coverage depends on product size, access requirements, and courier or transport arrangements.</p>
<h2>Returns</h2>
<p><strong>Can I return custom-fabricated items?</strong><br>Custom items are generally non-returnable unless faulty or not produced to the agreed specification.</p>
<p><strong>What should I do if my order arrives damaged?</strong><br>Contact us within 48 hours with photographs and your order reference so we can review and resolve the issue quickly.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p><strong>Can I speak with someone before ordering?</strong><br>Yes. You can contact the team directly to discuss specifications, lead times, and the right solution for your site.</p>
